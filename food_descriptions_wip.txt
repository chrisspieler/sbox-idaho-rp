Microwaved Burger:
	Tastes like the damp clap of naked fat.

Fast Food Pizza:
	A cardboard sled limply supporting a layer of 
	cheeselike grease. Promotes spider dreams. 

Ketchup:
	A fry sauce reagent and food group unto itself.

Basic Fry Sauce:
	The other staple food of Idaho. A pale pink mixture 
	of mayonnaise and ketchup.

Cold Steak:
	It would have been better raw.

Microwaved Steak:
	You've gone this far already, so why not dip it in ketchup?

Finger Steaks:
	Battered and deep-fried cuts of steak made for dipping.

Raw Potato:
	Firm like an apple, but rather dry. Hints of dirt,
	but filling nonetheless. 

	It's warm to the touch.

Baked Potato:
	A blossom of fluffed starch. You crave its replenishing
	warmth.

Steak Fries:
	Deep fried wedges of skinless potato.

French Fries:
	You're not quite sure who "French" is, but their fabulous 
	contribution to Idahoan cuisine will never be forgotten.

Deli Fries:
	Fries that were battered before being fried. The peak of
	Idaho cuisine.
